I used QT 6.7.1 (it doesn't matter at all)
Made just for fun. This is an old project that I did for the university. I decided to add a gui to it because I got bored.  
I wanted to make a parser of mathematical formulas so that the user could enter his own, but I was tired at the moment of creating the file parser.cpp so there is no parser here (it will be very cool if someone does it for me).
If the algorithm doesn't work correctly, I don't care.
